## Overview of Docker :whale

But what is Docker ?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure to deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the way you organize your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
